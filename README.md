# A-Model-for-A-Large-Scale-Fish-Classification
A ANN model for a large scale fish classification with python
There are 9000 images of 9 different fish species in the dataset. There are 1000 images of each class. These images have a .png extension. By writing the necessary code blocks, images with a .png extension were made suitable for entering the model. In this way, an example of solving real-life problems was given. The rleu activation function was used in the hidden layers. Since the multiple classification model was developed, the softmax algorithm was used in the output layer. Dropout layers and early stopping system were used to prevent overfitting.
